# Notes

**👋 Welcome to my Foam Knowledge Base!**

## Introduction

[Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) is a personal knowledge management and sharing system for VS Code. I use it for writing, organizing, and keeping re-discoverable my notes. 📓

This is my first try, I'll use [[getting-started]] to get familiar with my new knowledge base — it's still under construction. 🌱

By the way, my main site is [here](https://www.uniqiao.com/). 🌐

## Bubbles

There a few Bubbles (Markdown documents) to get started.

- [[inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for Markdown compatibility"
[getting-started]: getting-started.md "Getting Started"
[inbox]: inbox.md "Inbox"
[todo]: todo.md "Todo"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
